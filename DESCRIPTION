Description: Provides classes and methods for handling networks or graphs
  whose nodes are geographical (i.e. locations in the globe). Create
  a geonetwork object as a graph with node coordinates. Compute network 
  measures as with any graph while at the same time it supports spatial
  functionality (CRS transform, bbox, etc.). Plot the geonetwork and
  combine with supplementary cartography for spatial representation.
Depends: R (>= 3.2)
